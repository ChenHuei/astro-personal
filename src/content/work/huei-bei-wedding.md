For our wedding, we wanted to apply what weâ€™d learned, so we created a PWA website to provide guests with all the essential information, such as the date, schedule, venue, and transportation.

Additionally, we developed a LINE Bot to share the same details for friends who preferred using LINE. We also set up the backend to regularly share our pre-wedding photos with everyone and gently remind them as the big day drew closer!

On the wedding day, guests could send messages via the LINE Bot to share their wishes for the couple. These messages were displayed on a 360-degree screen at the venue, making it a memorable experience for everyone :-)
